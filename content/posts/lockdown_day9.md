2-April-2020

I was in a delusion since morning. Whether I should leave Directi or not. Nishant often tries to confuse. I was trying to get away from my decison by sleeping in the dat time & watching a lot of TV instead of solving problems. Upgrad guy called back trying to confirm whether I am still interested. I said yes. Why shouldn't I? They are paying more. But yeah, I would get swayed awayed a little from the path.
I wanted to be a product guy. Not necessarily product manager but someone who builds & launches features to the market. What an irony that I have not yet delpoyed any single thing yet and writing about it. The whole idea of coming here was about this. But what shall I do. Money is where the cookie crumbles. There I would continue to learn DS & Algo. I know for sure that that's the only skill everybody is looking right now & even Directi will take me in full time if I have it even anytime in future.
I think I have become a lot comfortable here. That is bad. For months I am trying to make myself busy with stuff & delay this very thought of decaying time. I think if I would have been in good hands it might not be that case. Still going with the flow it seems. I need 10x rule to rescue.
