30-April-2018
Head started the day with Computer networks. I was searching for the answer to, "What happens when you hit google.co?" Maybe I would like to explain it once.

This happened till before lunch. This took so much time but I won't have to do it again.

Post lunch I was overwhelmed with acheivements of the day & rested on some laureals. That proved to be time waster. Later before evening I tried to do something productive when the thought to make hugo blog crossed me. It took an hour or so & was futile.

Then, I decided to solve some problems from past interviews. It was again a little demoralizing. Then came time to pick up dadyji & it was already post evening.

Came home & can't remember anything but the 9pm Ramayan wigth food.

Little acheived.
