3-April-2020

It was quite frustrating day. I could'nt solve a very simple problem on codechef which gkcs had done with a very few attempts. It was just breaking my spirit by each passing minute. So, I decided to taka a break.

I watched a youtube channel called shiey. Amazing guy. He was train surfing in cargo trains in Ukraine. The real subway surfer. He would climb on to appopiate trains to reach Black sea at the end. What a normadic & crude approach!

After that I started solving April challenge in the evening. Still figuring out the first problem. Though second one gave me a green tick which injected ecstacy back into me. Was figuring out the third question when lights out time approached.
Bye!
