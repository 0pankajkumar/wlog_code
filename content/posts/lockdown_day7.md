31-April-2019

It was an unusual day. Atleast it felt so. An unknown calm was lurking around since morning.

I wanted to do backtracking questions today. But during question selection I lost myself to dp problem of rod cutting. Everywhere on internet they advocated bottom up approach which is still hard for me to comprehend. But, I think I won;t be able to complete everything without it. So, I'll try again maybe with a different question. So, all this happened till lunch.

After lunch my laptop was busy with didi. So, I decided to grab this opportunity to read computer networks. My goal was to look at all headers of various layers to know better about the tight packing happenning. I ended up reading more about http, smtp etc which further strengthened my concepts. I refrained away from Transport layer as it was looking less attractive at that hour. But I ended up reading RSA encyption algorithm. They I still will find it hard to replicate but can surely satisfy someone about it's richness & usefulness.

After that I went for a walk in the evening. I figured out that Ranchit Jain from iitr is has made a new account on codechef recently in 2017. He says that he started coding in 4th semester which must be somewhere in 2015. But it's not like that. His first submission is in 2017. Maybe he doesn't want us to see his real struggle. Found that gkcs on codechef is genuine & can be followed.

After some timepass it rang that codeforces round was about to start at 7. But it was also time to fetch papa. Came home after sometime & started. Problem A seemed easy but only after a number of iterations of reading the question again & again. But still I could'nt solve it. Damn! What am I doing wrong? Am I doing too much competition in premature stage itself? Let me solve a lot of problems then.

Ended up eating food after watching Ramayan. Peace for the day. Progressing very slowly.

Acheivements:
Computer networks: http, RSA
Rod cutting DP attempted unsuccessfully
