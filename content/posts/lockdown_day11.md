5-April-2020

Yeah! I missed day10. I was solving some codechef long challenege problems.
Today also I was doing the same. For the first time I was venturing out to problems beyond first two problems. I was surprsied to find that problems were not of an alien concept. No doubt they are difficult to crack even now. But atleast I can think in a direction & try. They are mostly mathematical based with use of tricks to minimise computations at times. Since, I haven't yet figure out them I can only guess as of now.

Watched a series on North Korea. The person covering the documentary was from Russia. Upon returning back to his homeland even the russian was feeling librated. I always complained why my grandfathers didn't run to Americas or Europe so that I would have born in a decent country. But now it felt like India atleast gurantees so much freedom for free which we often take for granted.

Hoping to continue with long challenge for can't take it as mainstream. Hopefully tomorrow Upgrad will release the offer.
